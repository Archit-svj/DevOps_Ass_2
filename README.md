Continuous integration and testing pipeline


A developer truly just wants to exist in the pull request world, where everything is automated, always works, and you push after every commit. In this world, you can deploy our complete service from a single environment. We may roll it all back if the production runs into trouble. In an ideal world, we wouldn't ever need to leave GitHub. It is where managed changes, start all workflows, have meetings, and store any other "config" that is required for subsequent operations. After we commit to the main branch, this content just disappears onto a conveyor belt, unless it breaks.


Transformation of DevOps Throughout the Product

We wanted to consider the developer experience and approach continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) as an architecture throughout the product as part of Autodesk's DevOps journey. How are features including source code, desktop program, several back-end cloud services, and mobile program developed and deployed?
Not all things have to match. Everything is gaining popularity in an ever-changing market.
We began that transformation five years before he did.



Test case:
#1) Maintaining a standard repository of reusable test cases for your application will ensure that the most common bugs will be caught more quickly.
#2) A checklist helps to complete writing test cases quickly for new versions of the application.
#3) Reusing the test cases helps to save money on resources to write repetitive tests.
#4) Important test cases will be covered always, thereby making it almost impossible to forget.
#5) The testing checklist can be referred by developers to ensure if the most common issues are fixed in the development phase itself.
